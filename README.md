# My Personal Portfolio (Built with Dora.run)

This is my portfolio website, created using [Dora.run](https://www.dora.run), a no-code web builder. I used it to quickly design and share my work, projects, and background in one place.

## Why No-Code?
I wanted to focus on content and presentation without getting caught up in front-end coding. Dora made it easy to get a clean, responsive site up and running.
